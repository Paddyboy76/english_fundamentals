	<h1>Unit 1 - Describing People</h1>

	<h2>Describing Physical Characteristics</h2>

	<p>When discussing a person's appearance, it's important to employ language that is respectful and considerate. Let's explore how to describe someone's height and body shape in English.</p>

	<h3>Describing Height</h3>

	<p>When it comes to height, English speakers commonly use three descriptors: tall, medium-height, or short. However, there are exceptions for extreme heights:</p>

	<p>For individuals who are not particularly tall, we might say:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>He is not very tall.</li>
		<li>He is a little on the short side.</li>
		<li>She is not that tall.</li>
		<li>She is kind of petite.</li>
		<li>She is tiny.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>"Petite" is often used to describe a woman, especially if she is short and small in build.</p>

	<p>When someone is exceptionally tall, we might use expressions like:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>He is a giant.</li>
		<li>He is huge</li>
		<li>He towers over others.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>But it's crucial to use these terms with caution, especially when discussing a person's height directly to them.</p>

	<p>It's also important to note that such terms might not be suitable for describing a very tall woman, as it could make her feel uncomfortable.</p>

	<h3>Describing Body Shape and Size</h3>

	<p>When discussing a person's build, it's crucial to choose words that are sensitive and respectful, especially in English-speaking countries where directness about someone's body can be considered impolite.</p>

	<h4>Big/Small</h4>

	<p>The term "big" can refer to someone who is tall and strong, but it's often used as a euphemism for overweight. Describing someone as "big" should be done with caution, especially when talking about a woman.</p>

	<p>Conversely, "small" may denote someone who is short or thin.</p>

	<h4>Fat/Thin</h4>

	<p>"Fat" and "thin" can be considered insensitive. Instead, use alternatives like "overweight" or "slim." Avoid using "fat" directly, especially when describing someone to their face. Saying "You look more fat today" is very insulting.</p>

	<p>For close friends or family, more direct terms like "overweight" or "obese" might be acceptable, but use them with care.</p>

	<h4>Muscular</h4>

	<p>"Muscular" describes someone with well-developed muscles, often due to regular gym workouts. However, be cautious when using this term for women, as it may not be desired.</p>

	<p>Avoid using "strong" to describe a slim, fit person; "fit" or "athletic" is more appropriate. Never say "He is strong." Do not describe someone as "Fit and firm.", instead, use "Athletic"</p>

	<h4>Athletic</h4>

	<p>An "athletic" person is slim with little body fat, often due to regular exercise like running. Avoid using "strong" in this context; "fit" is a better choice.</p>

	<p>In summary, when describing someone's build, it's essential to choose words carefully, considering cultural sensitivities and the individual's feelings.</p>

	<h3>Describing Head &amp; Face</h3>

	<p>In English, comments on the size of a person's head are rare and should be approached with caution, as they can be perceived negatively.</p>

	<h4>Head Size</h4>

	<p>Comments about head size are typically reserved for extreme cases, like someone with a very large or tiny head. Even then, it's essential to be sensitive.</p>

	<p>Acceptable expressions include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"He has a really big head."</li>
		<li>"He has a large head."</li>
		<li>"Her head is kind of small."</li>
		<li>"She has a very small head."</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Hair Color</h4>

	<p>Hair color varies widely, but it can generally be categorized into several main shades:</p>

	<h5>Brown Hair</h5>

	<p>Brown hair is common, and shades can range from light to dark.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"She has light-brown hair."</li>
		<li>"He has dark-brown hair."</li>
		<li>"She has mousy-brown hair," which is a light-brown color often found in Europe or America, and is sometimes humorously referred to by women.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Blonde Hair</h5>

	<p>Instead of "golden," use "blonde" to describe this hair color.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"She has blonde hair."</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Red Hair</h5>

	<p>Red hair is less common but still exists.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"He has red hair."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Some may refer to a person with red hair as a "redhead," but avoid using "ginger" as it can be perceived negatively.</p>

	<h5>Grey/White Hair</h5>

	<p>Grey or white hair is often associated with aging.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"She has grey hair."</li>
		<li>"His hair is almost white."</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>No Hair</h5>

	<p>Hair loss can be gradual, so one would be "balding". Once all hair is gone, one will be bald.</p>

	<p>In summary, when describing someone's head and hair, it's important to use respectful language and avoid making negative comments about appearance.</p>

	<h3>Describing the Face</h3>

	<p>After discussing a person's general body appearance, we move on to describe their face, focusing on positive or negative attributes.</p>

	<h4>Attractiveness</h4>

	<p>Positive attributes are typically expressed as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"He is a really handsome guy."</li>
		<li>"She is so beautiful."</li>
		<li>"They are both very good-looking."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For a person who isn't considered attractive, more sensitive language may be used:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"He is not very good-looking."</li>
		<li>"He is not so handsome."</li>
	</ul>

	<p>A neutral term could be "ordinary looking."</p>
